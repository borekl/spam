<H2>Overview</H2>
</A>

<DIV CLASS="i">
<P>Collector is the core component of Switch Ports Activity
Monitor (SPAM). Collector is a program (written in Perl), that gathers
status information about ports from switches using SNMP. The retrieved data
are stored to table <B>status</B> in backend database. The collector
retrieves port status (up/down), duplex status, speed, VLAN membership,
bridging information, in/out bytes counter and other values. Some other
auxiliary tables are also maintained by the collector. The collector is run
on regular basis from cron(8). At the time of writing this (Februrary 2010)
one full run takes full two hours to complete.</P>

<p>The collector uses lock file <tt>spam.lock</tt> in <tt>/tmp</tt>
directory to avoid being run in more than one instance. In case the
collector crashes or the host computer is rebooted during run, this file
must be manually deleted.</p>

<A NAME="ch_options">
<H2>Command Line Options</H2>
</A>

<DIV CLASS="i">
<DL>

  <DT>--arptable, --noarptable
  <DD>this option turns on or off retrieval of ARP table from defined core routers
  (default off)

  <dt>--autoreg
  <dd>this option enables autoregistration, that is automatic entry of
  outlets into <tt>porttable</tt> from specially formatted descriptions
  (default off)
  
  <DT>--mactable, --nomactable
  <DD>this option turns on or off retrieval of dot1d bridging table switches and
  updating appropriate table in backend database (default on)

  <DT>--vlanlist, --novlanlist
  <DD>this option turns on or off generating of VLAN list (default off)

  <DT>--quick
  <DD>this option is equivalent of using
  <TT>--noarptable</TT>, <TT>--nomactable</TT>  and <TT>--novlanlist</TT> together

  <DT>--host=<SPAN CLASS="val">host</SPAN>
  <DD>this option constrains polling to only host; this option can be used
  more than once for polling just a few hosts; also partial matches count as
  well: so --host=vin matches all vinS00c, vins20c and so on

  <dt>--tasks=<span class="val">N</span>
  <dd>specifies number of hosts to be processed in parallel; default value
  is 8, maximum is 16
  
  <DT>--maint
  <DD>this option invokes backend database maintenance, which includes
  purging stale entries from mactable and arptable

  <DT>--hosts
  <DD>this option lists all switches that SPAM knows about and would poll
  if full run were invoked; this list is pulled from ONdb database
  
  <DT>--arpservers
  <DD>this option lists all ARP servers that SPAM knows about and would poll
  if full run were invoked; this list is pulled from ONdb database
    
  <DT>--help, -?
  <DD>this option causes the SPAM collector to write out brief help and then
  exit without any further action

<A NAME="ch_config">
<H2>Configuration File</H2>
</A>

<DIV CLASS="i">
<P>SPAM collector reads configuration file <tt>spam.cfg</tt> in
its current directory. The configuration is plain text file with following
configuration statements.</P>

<DL>

  <DT>htmldir <SPAN CLASS="val">path</SPAN>
  <DD>This statement defines where the HTML pages will be generated

  <DT>inactivethreshold <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Ports showing no activity for this long will be marked as inactive

  <DT>inactivethreshold2 <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Ports showing no activity for this long will be marked as long time
  inactive

  <DT>excludehost <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>Force not processing of this host

  <DT>patchmap <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>Include patch panel map with ports listing

  <DT>knownports <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>This will turn on special processing of registered ports (ie. ports that
  are in table "porttable" in backend database); for these switches ports,
  that are inactive will be either grayed out (if they are unregistered) or
  marked inactive; also when port is found active and it is unregistered, it
  will generate a warning

  <DT>arpserver <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="val">community</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines host(s) that will be queried for their ARP tables;
  SPAM stores ARP tables to map MACs to IPs which enables users to search by
  IP addresses; use this command several times to include more than one
  router. Note, that host(s) defined with this statement will be used <I>in
  addition</I> to hosts pulled from ONdb database.

  <DT>vlanserver <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="val">community</SPAN>
  <SPAN CLASS="val">vtpdomain</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines host that will be queried for their VTP VLAN database;
  the host should be Catalyst 6500-class switch and in VTP master mode;
  only one host per VTP domain is allowed

  <DT>community <SPAN CLASS="val">community-string</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines SNMP community string to be used to poll hosts and
  retrieve ARP table from routers

  <DT>arptableage <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Defines threshold age above which arptable entries will be purged
  from database during maintenance run

  <DT>mactableage <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Defines threshold age above which mactable entries will be purged
  from database during maintenance run
 
  <dt>dbconn <span CLASS="val">id</span>
  <span CLASS="val">user</span>/<span CLASS="val">password</span>:<span CLASS="val">database</span>[@<span CLASS="val">host</span>]
  <dd>This statement defines backend database connection parameters; host
  definition is optional--when none is supplied localhost is used; currently
  two id's must be defined for SPAM: <b>spam</b>, which connects the collector to
  its native backend database; and <b>ondb</b> which is used to get list of
  switches and arpservers from the Oskar Network Database.

  <dt>snmpwalk <span class="val">cmdline</span>
  <dt>snmpget <span class="val">cmdline</span>
  <dd>These two statement define command-line to perform SNMP walk and SNMP
  get operations.

  <dt>siteconv <span class="val">site</span> <span class="val">alias</span>
  <dd>This statement lets SPAM know, that <i>alias</i> is actually the same
  physical site as <i>site</i> (ie. <b>ric</b> is the same site as
  <b>rcn</b>). This is used to know that eg. switch <b>ricS03g</b> is at
  site <b>rcn</b>.
