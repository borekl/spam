<DIV CLASS="i">
<P>Collector is the core component of Switch Ports Activity
Monitor (SPAM). Collector is a program (written in Perl), that gathers
status information about ports from switches using SNMP. The retrieved data
are stored to table <B>status</B> in backend database. The collector
retrieves port status (up/down), duplex status, speed, VLAN membership,
bridging information, in/out bytes counter and other values. Some other
auxiliary tables are also maintained by the collector. The collector is run
on regular basis from cron(8). At the time of writing this (Februrary 2010)
one full run takes full two hours to complete.</P>

<DIV CLASS="i">
<P><IMG SRC="html-swlist.png"></P>

<P>After its every run, unless inhibited by <TT>--noreport</TT> command-line
switch, the collector generates list of switches it monitors along with
quick statistics for each. The fields are following:</P>

<DL>
  <DT>device
  <DD>hostname of the device; it is an hyperlink that leads to list of ports
  for given switch

  <DT>location
  <DD>contents of SNMP sysLocation.0 variable

  <DT>ports total
  <DD>number of ports physically present at given switch

  <DT>ports patched
  <DD>number of ports connected to network outlets; this number is retrieved
  from backend database and is only available for devices, for which the
  port tracking is enabled by <TT>KnownPorts</TT> configuration statement;
  this number is given along with percentage of total ports

  <DT>ports active
  <DD>number of ports reported by switch to be in "up" state, ie. detecting
  link; this number is given along with percentage of total ports
  
  <DT>ports unreg
  <DD>number of ports that are active, but not registered in database;
  this can be non-zero only for switches with enabled port tracking
  (<TT>KnownPorts</TT> configuration statement).
  
  <DT>ports errdis
  <DD>number of ports that are reported by switch to be in "errordisable"
  state

<H2>Port lists</H2>
</A>

<DIV CLASS="i">

<P>For every switch the collector generates ports listing with various
information about each port. The listings differ slightly depending on
whether port tracking is enable or not for given switch.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="html-portlist1.png"></P>

<P>Above picture shows port listing on a switch with port usage tracking
disabled. All ports names are either green or red to indicate up or down
state.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="html-portlist2.png"></P>

<P>Above picture shows port listing on a switch with port tracking
enabled. The main difference is, that ports can have, besides up and down,
also inactive state, that means no outlet is connected to the port. The
inactive state is indicated by grey colour of port name.</P>

<P>Meaning of each field is explained in following list:</P>

<DL>

  <DT>port
  <DD>shows port name and port state; ports can have these states with
  visual representation given in brackets:
  <UL>
    <LI>up (<TT><SPAN CLASS="portup">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
    <LI>down  (<TT><SPAN CLASS="portdown">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
    <LI>inactive (<TT><SPAN CLASS="portdown-unpatched">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
    <LI>disabled (<TT><SPAN CLASS="portdis">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
    <LI>unregistered (<TT><SPAN CLASS="portup-illegal">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
    <LI>errordisabled (<TT><SPAN CLASS="porterrdis">4/36</SPAN></TT>)
  <UL>

  <DT>dupl
  <DD>shows port duplex state; can be either <TT><SPAN CLASS="dplxhalf">half</SPAN></TT>,
  <TT><SPAN CLASS="dplxfull">full</SPAN></TT> or none (when port is not up)
  
  <DT>rate
  <DD>shows port speed and is usualy one of 10M, 100M or 1G
  
  <DT>flags
  <DD>shows additional port flags:
  <UL>
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-cdp">C</SPAN></TT>: port receives CDP messages
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-pfast">F</SPAN></TT>: port is in spanning tree
    "fast start" mode
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-str">R</SPAN></TT>: port is spanning tree root port
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-trunk">q</SPAN></TT>: port is in 802.1q trunking mode
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-trunk">i</SPAN></TT>: port is in ISL trunking mode
    <LI><TT><SPAN CLASS="flag-trunk">?</SPAN></TT>: port is in unknown/other trunking mode
  </UL>

  <DT>vlan
  <DD>shows port VLAN membership
  
  <DT>cp
  <DD>shows consolidation point name the port is patched to
  
  <DT>outlet
  <DD>shows network outlet associated with the consolidation point the port
  is connected to
  
  <DT>inactivity
  <DD>shows for how long the port has seen no incoming or outgoing traffic;
  this figure can have several forms:
  <UL>
    <LI>completely missing - means the port is inactive for less time
    than specified in <TT>inactivethreshold</TT> configuration statement --
    that is for short period of time (default 1 day); note: this masking
    of short-term inactivity is only used for ports that are patched!, other
    ports always show how long they have been inactive
    <LI>is in light typeface - means the port is inactive for less time
    than specified in <TT>inactivethreshold2</TT> but more than
    <TT>inactivethreshold</TT> -- that is for not very long (default is
    more than 1 day and less than 7 days)
    <LI>is in bold typeface - means the port is inactive for more time
    than specified in <TT>inactivethreshold2</TT> (default is more than 7
    days)
  </UL>

  <DT>description
  <DD>shows port description reported by switch
  
  <DT>location
  <DD>shows outlet location for given outlet -- if it is in database

<DIV CLASS="i">
<P>SPAM collector reads configuration file <tt>spam.cfg</tt> in
its current directory. The configuration is plain text file with following
configuration statements.</P>

<DL>

  <DT>htmldir <SPAN CLASS="val">path</SPAN>
  <DD>This statement defines where the HTML pages will be generated

  <DT>inactivethreshold <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Ports showing no activity for this long will be marked as inactive

  <DT>inactivethreshold2 <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Ports showing no activity for this long will be marked as long time
  inactive

  <DT>excludehost <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>Force not processing of this host

  <DT>patchmap <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>Include patch panel map with ports listing

  <DT>knownports <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN>
  <DD>This will turn on special processing of registered ports (ie. ports that
  are in table "porttable" in backend database); for these switches ports,
  that are inactive will be either grayed out (if they are unregistered) or
  marked inactive; also when port is found active and it is unregistered, it
  will generate a warning

  <DT>arpserver <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="val">community</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines host(s) that will be queried for their ARP tables;
  SPAM stores ARP tables to map MACs to IPs which enables users to search by
  IP addresses; use this command several times to include more than one router

  <DT>vlanserver <SPAN CLASS="val">hostname</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="val">community</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines host that will be queried for their VTP VLAN database;
  the host should be Catalyst 6000 class switch and in VTP master mode;
  only one host is allowed

  <DT>community <SPAN CLASS="val">community-string</SPAN>
  <DD>This command defines SNMP community string to be used to poll hosts and
  retrieve ARP table from routers

  <DT>arptableage <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Defines threshold age above which arptable entries will be purged
  from database during maintenance run

  <DT>mactableage <SPAN CLASS="val">seconds</SPAN>
  <DD>Defines threshold age above which mactable entries will be purged
  from database during maintenance run
 
  <dt>dbconn <span CLASS="val">id</span>
  <span CLASS="val">user</span>/<span CLASS="val">password</span>:<span CLASS="val">database</span>[@<span CLASS="val">host</span>]
  <dd>This statement defines backend database connection parameters; host
  definition is optional--when none is supplied localhost is used; currently
  two id's must be defined for SPAM: <b>spam</b>, which connects the collector to
  its native backend database; and <b>ondb</b> which is used to get list of
  switches and arpservers from the Oskar Network Database.
